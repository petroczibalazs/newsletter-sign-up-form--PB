## My process

I used NotebookLM to collect resources and took notes on key issues while watching a professional solution. Then I implemented the project entirely on my own.

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* CSS Grid
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to layer JavaScript-based form validation on top of the browser’s built-in validation and use state selectors like `:not()` and `:placeholder-shown` to control when error messages appear.

### Continued development

I plan to continue studying form styling and form validation in more depth.
